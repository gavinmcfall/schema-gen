This uses the client/server bandwidth extensively through a COPY. pgbench uses the FREEZE option with version 14 or later of PostgreSQL to speed up subsequent VACUUM, unless partitions are enabled. Using g causes logging to print one message every 100,000 rows while generating data for the pgbench_accounts table.\n  With `G` (server-side data generation), only small queries are sent from the pgbench client and then data is actually generated in the server. No significant bandwidth is required for this variant, but the server will do more work. Using G causes logging not to print any progress message while generating data.\n  The default initialization behavior uses client-side data generation (equivalent to g).\n* `v` (Vacuum): Invoke VACUUM on the standard tables.\n* `p` (create Primary keys): Create primary key indexes on the standard tables.\n* `f` (create Foreign keys): Create foreign key constraints between the standard tables.
