Health check parameters\nthat are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks\nthat exist in the container image (such as those specified in a parent image\nor from the image's Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the HEALTHCHECK\nparameter of docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).\n\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks\nspecified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health\nchecks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container\ndefinition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition\noverride any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.\n\n\nYou can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with\nthe DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.\n\n\nThe health check is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent\nrestarts, upgrades, or temporary unavailability.\n\n\nThe following describes the possible healthStatus values for a container:\n\n\n   * HEALTHY-The container health check has passed successfully.\n\n\n   * UNHEALTHY-The container health check has failed.\n\n\n   * UNKNOWN-The container health check is being evaluated or there's no\n   container health check defined.\n\n\nThe following describes the possible healthStatus values for a task. The\ncontainer health check status of non-essential containers don't have an effect\non the health status of a task.\n\n\n   * HEALTHY-All essential containers within the task have passed their health\n   checks.\n\n\n   * UNHEALTHY-One or more essential containers have failed their health\n   check.\n\n\n   * UNKNOWN-The essential containers within the task are still having their\n   health checks evaluated, there are only nonessential containers with health\n   checks defined, or there are no container health checks defined.\n\n\nIf a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue\nits lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of\na service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped\nand the service scheduler will replace it.\n\n\nThe following are notes about container health check support:\n\n\n   * When the Amazon ECS agent cannot connect to the Amazon ECS service,\n   the service reports the container as UNHEALTHY.\n\n\n   * The health check statuses are the \"last heard from\" response from the\n   Amazon ECS agent. There are no assumptions made about the status of the\n   container health checks.\n\n\n   * Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon\n   ECS container agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS\n   container agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html).\n\n\n   * Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using\n   platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see Fargate platform\n   versions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).\n\n\n   * Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of\n   a service that's configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.",

However, the container might use a different logging driver than the\nDocker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition.\nFor more information about the options for different supported log drivers,\nsee Configure logging drivers (https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/)\nin the Docker documentation.\n\n\nUnderstand the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers.\n\n\n   * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available\n   to the Docker daemon. Additional log drivers may be available in future\n   releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. For tasks on Fargate, the\n   supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens. For tasks\n   hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are awslogs,\n   fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald, logentries,syslog, splunk, and awsfirelens.\n\n\n   * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater\n   on your container instance.\n\n\n   * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container\n   agent must register the available logging drivers with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS\n   environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use\n   these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS\n   container agent configuration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html)\n   in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.\n\n\n   * For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't have access to the\n   underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software\n   needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd\n   output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs\n   to.",

This configuration maps to the HEALTHCHECK\nparameter of docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).\n\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks\nspecified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health\nchecks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container\ndefinition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition\noverride any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.\n\n\nYou can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with\nthe DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.\n\n\nThe health check is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent\nrestarts, upgrades, or temporary unavailability.\n\n\nThe following describes the possible healthStatus values for a container:\n\n\n   * HEALTHY-The container health check has passed successfully.\n\n\n   * UNHEALTHY-The container health check has failed.\n\n\n   * UNKNOWN-The container health check is being evaluated or there's no\n   container health check defined.\n\n\nThe following describes the possible healthStatus values for a task. The\ncontainer health check status of non-essential containers don't have an effect\non the health status of a task.\n\n\n   * HEALTHY-All essential containers within the task have passed their health\n   checks.\n\n\n   * UNHEALTHY-One or more essential containers have failed their health\n   check.\n\n\n   * UNKNOWN-The essential containers within the task are still having their\n   health checks evaluated, there are only nonessential containers with health\n   checks defined, or there are no container health checks defined.\n\n\nIf a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue\nits lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of\na service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped\nand the service scheduler will replace it.\n\n\nThe following are notes about container health check support:\n\n\n   * When the Amazon ECS agent cannot connect to the Amazon ECS service,\n   the service reports the container as UNHEALTHY.\n\n\n   * The health check statuses are the \"last heard from\" response from the\n   Amazon ECS agent. There are no assumptions made about the status of the\n   container health checks.\n\n\n   * Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon\n   ECS container agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS\n   container agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html).\n\n\n   * Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using\n   platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see Fargate platform\n   versions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).\n\n\n   * Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of\n   a service that's configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.",
